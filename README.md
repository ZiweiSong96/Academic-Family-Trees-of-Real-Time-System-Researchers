# The Academic Family Tree of Real-Time System Researchers
Here are the academic family trees of researchers who study on real-time system. These outstanding researchers come from UK, USA, Italy, Hong Kong......

The research areas include Hard/Soft Real Time Scheduling, CPS designing, Real-Time Embedded System and so on.

I checked the University Library websites and the publication information in their early career to figure out the possible relationship, so there might be some mistakes. 

Real Time, Best Time!
